# HOW TO EDIT THIS FILE:
# The "handy ruler" below makes it easier to edit a package description.
# Line up the first '|' above the ':' following the base package name, and
# the '|' on the right side marks the last column you can put a character in.
# You must make exactly 11 lines for the formatting to be correct.  It's also
# customary to leave one space after the ':' except on otherwise blank lines.

ipfs-pack: ipfs-pack - filesystem packing tool
ipfs-pack:
ipfs-pack: ipfs-pack is a tool and library to work with ipfs and large
ipfs-pack: collections of data in UNIX/POSIX filesystems. It identifies singular
ipfs-pack: collections or bundles of data (the pack), creates a light-weight
ipfs-pack: cryptographically secure manifest that preserves the integrity of the
ipfs-pack: collection over time, and travels with the data (PackManifest). It
ipfs-pack: helps use ipfs in a mode that references the filesystem files directly
ipfs-pack: and avoids duplicating data (filestore). It carries a standard dataset
ipfs-pack: metadata file to capture and present information about the dataset and
ipfs-pack: also helps verify the authenticity of data through a file carrying
ipfs-pack: cryptographic signatures (PackAuth). Works best with go-ipfs.
